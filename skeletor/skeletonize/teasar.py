def by_teasar(mesh, inv_dist, min_length=None, root=None, progress=True):
    """Skeletonize a mesh mesh using the TEASAR algorithm [1].

    This algorithm finds the longest path from a root vertex, invalidates all
    vertices that are within `inv_dist`. Then picks the second longest (and
    still valid) path and does the same. Rinse & repeat until all vertices have
    been invalidated. It's fast + works very well with tubular meshes, and with
    `inv_dist` you have control over the level of detail. Note that by its
    nature the skeleton will be exactly on the surface of the mesh.

    Based on the implementation by Sven Dorkenwald, Casey Schneider-Mizell and
    Forrest Collman in `meshparty` (https://github.com/sdorkenw/MeshParty).

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh :          mesh obj
                    The mesh to be skeletonize. Can an object that has
                    ``.vertices`` and ``.faces`` properties  (e.g. a
                    trimesh.Trimesh) or a tuple ``(vertices, faces)`` or a
                    dictionary ``{'vertices': vertices, 'faces': faces}``.
    inv_dist :      int | float
                    Distance along the mesh used for invalidation of vertices.
                    This controls how detailed (or noisy) the skeleton will be.
    min_length :    float, optional
                    If provided, will skip any branch that is shorter than
                    `min_length`. Use this to get rid of noise but note that
                    it will lead to vertices not being mapped to skeleton nodes.
                    Such vertices will show up with index -1 in
                    `Skeleton.mesh_map`.
    root :          int, optional
                    Vertex ID of a root. If not provided will use ``0``.
    progress :      bool, optional
                    If True, will show progress bar.

    Returns
    -------
    skeletor.Skeleton
                    Holds results of the skeletonization and enables quick
                    visualization.
