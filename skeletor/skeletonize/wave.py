    """Skeletonize a mesh using wave fronts.

    The algorithm tries to find rings of vertices and collapse them to
    their center. This is done by propagating a wave across the mesh starting at
    a single seed vertex. As the wave travels across the mesh we keep track of
    which vertices are are encountered at each step. Groups of connected
    vertices that are "hit" by the wave at the same time are considered rings
    and subsequently collapsed. By its nature this works best with tubular meshes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh :          mesh obj
                    The mesh to be skeletonize. Can an object that has
                    ``.vertices`` and ``.faces`` properties  (e.g. a
                    trimesh.Trimesh) or a tuple ``(vertices, faces)`` or a
                    dictionary ``{'vertices': vertices, 'faces': faces}``.
    waves :         int
                    Number of waves to run across the mesh. Each wave is
                    initialized at a different vertex which produces slightly
                    different rings. The final skeleton is produced from a mean
                    across all waves. More waves produce higher resolution
                    skeletons but also introduce more noise.
    origins :       int | list of ints, optional
                    Vertex ID(s) where the wave(s) are initialized. If we run
                    out of origins (either because less `origins` than `waves`
                    or because no origin for one of the connected components)
                    will fall back to semi-random origin.
    step_size :     int
                    Values greater 1 effectively lead to binning of rings. For
                    example a stepsize of 2 means that two adjacent vertex rings
                    will be collapsed to the same center. This can help reduce
                    noise in the skeleton (and as such counteracts a large
                    number of waves).
    radius_agg :    "mean" | "median" | "max" | "min" | "percentile75" | "percentile25"
                    Function used to aggregate radii over sample (i.e. the
                    vertices forming a ring that we collapse to its center).
    progress :      bool
                    If True, will show progress bar.

    Returns
    -------
    skeletor.Skeleton
                    Holds results of the skeletonization and enables quick
                    visualization.
