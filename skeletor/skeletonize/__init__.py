r"""
The `skeletor.skeletonize` module contains functions to for skeletonization
of meshes.

There are several approaches to skeletonizing a mesh. Which one to pick depends
(among other things) on the shape of your mesh and the skeleton quality you want
to get out of it. In general, unless you mesh already looks like a tube I
recommend looking into mesh contraction [^1].

Please see the documentation of the individual functions for details but here
is a quick summary:

| function                                    | speed | robust | radii [^2] | mesh map [^3] | description                                        |
| ------------------------------------------- | :---: | :----: | :--------: | :-----------: | ---------------------------------------------------|
| `skeletor.skeletonize.by_wavefront()`       | ++++  | ++     | yes        | yes           | works well for tubular meshes                      |
| `skeletor.skeletonize.by_wavefront_exact()` | +++   | ++     | yes        | no            | works well for tubular meshes                      |
| `skeletor.skeletonize.by_vertex_clusters()` | ++    | +      | no         | yes           | best with contracted meshes [^1]                   |
| `skeletor.skeletonize.by_teasar()`          | +     | ++     | no         | yes           | works on mesh surface                              |
| `skeletor.skeletonize.by_tangent_ball()`    | ++    | 0      | yes        | yes           | works with mesh normals                            |
| `skeletor.skeletonize.by_edge_collapse()`   | -     | 0      | no         | no            | published with [1] - never got this to work well   |

[^1]: use `skeletor.pre.contract()`
[^2]: radii can also be added in postprocessing with `skeletor.post.radii()`
[^3]: a mapping from the meshes vertices to skeleton nodes
